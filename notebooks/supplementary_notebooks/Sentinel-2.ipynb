    "This notebook can be used to create a Sentinel-2 cloud-filtered median mosaic for any time period and location. A median mosaic is quite common and reflects the \"median\" value of cloud-free pixels for all spectral bands in the time series. The mosaic can be output as a GeoTIFF product for further analysis and can also be used to generate spectral index products using mathematical combinations of bands, such as NDVI. The baseline data is [Sentinel-2 Level-2A](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/sentinel-2-l2a) data from the MS Planetary Computer catalog."

We will only keep the desired bands (Red, Green, Blue, NIR). There are also several other <b>important settings for the data</b>: We have changed the projection to epsg=4326 which is standard latitude-longitude in degrees. We have specified the spatial resolution of each pixel to be 10-meters, which is the baseline accuracy for this data. This resolution can be easily changed below (e.g. 100 meters) to reduce the data volume of the final GeoTIFF output. This change may be neccesary when considering larger analysis regions. Also, we have selected a resampling method of \"average\" that will find the mean value of each band to create new pixels. This is only needed when the resolution is changed from 10-meters to larger values (e.g. 100 meters). "
